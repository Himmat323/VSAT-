            <h2>Introduction to Bio Energy</h2>
            <p>Bioenergy refers to the energy derived from biological sources, such as plants, animals, and their
                byproducts. It plays a crucial role in the transition towards renewable energy, helping to reduce
                greenhouse
                gas emissions and reliance on fossil fuels. Key forms of bioenergy include biofuels, biogas, and
                biomass.
            </p>

                <h2>BioCBG (Compressed Bio Gas)</h2>
                <p>Bio-CBG is a form of biogas that is purified and compressed for use as a fuel. It is produced through
                    the
                    anaerobic digestion of organic materials such as agricultural residue, manure, municipal waste, and
                    other biodegradable feedstocks. <br>

                    Production Process: Organic waste is decomposed by bacteria in an oxygen-free environment, producing
                    biogas
                    primarily composed of methane and carbon dioxide. <br>
                    Applications BioCBG is used as a vehicle fuel, for heating, and for electricity generation. It can
                    replace
                    conventional natural gas in many applications. <br>
                    Benefits Reduces greenhouse gas emissions, helps manage waste, and can be produced from locally
                    available
                    feedstock, supporting energy security. <br>
                    Ethanol
                    Ethanol is an alcohol-based biofuel typically produced by fermenting sugars from crops like corn,
                    sugarcane,
                    and other biomass. It is commonly blended with gasoline to produce fuel for vehicles. <br> <br>

        <div class="bio3rd">

            <p>
                Production Process: The biomass is first converted into sugars through enzymatic or chemical processes,
                followed by fermentation using yeast, which converts the sugars into ethanol and carbon dioxide.
                Application's: Used as a fuel additive to reduce emissions, improve octane ratings, and decrease
                reliance on fossil fuels. E85 (85% ethanol, 15% gasoline) is a popular blend in some regions. <br>
                Benefits: Reduces greenhouse gas emissions, promotes energy independence, and supports agricultural
                economies. <br>
                Waste to Energy
                Waste to Energy (WtE) involves converting non-recyclable waste materials into usable forms of energy,
                such as electricity, heat, or fuels. This is achieved through various processes like combustion,
                gasification, anaerobic digestion, and pyrolysis. <br>

                Combustion Direct burning of waste to produce heat, which is then used to generate electricity. <br>

                Gasification: Converts organic or fossil-based carbonaceous materials into carbon monoxide, hydrogen,
                and
                carbon dioxide at high temperatures. <br>

                Anaerobic Digestion: Microbial process that breaks down organic material in the absence of oxygen,
                producing
                biogas and digestate. <br>

                Pyrolysis: Thermochemical decomposition of materials at elevated temperatures in the absence of oxygen.
                <br>

                Application's: Generates electricity and heat produces biogas for fuel, and creates biochar as a soil
                amendment. <br>

                Benefits Reduces landfill use, lowers greenhouse gas emissions, and recovers valuable energy from waste
                materials. <br>
